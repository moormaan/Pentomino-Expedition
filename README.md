# Godot Version Updater Plugin
This is a tool designed to help update Godot to the latest version within the editor. This plugin eliminates the need to manually download, extract, and open up the newest version of Godot from the Godot website. Upgrade your Godot version for Windows, Linux, MacOS, and Android from within the Editor.

## Notice 
This plugin is a work-in-progress tool. Please know that I do not own a MacBook, so the MacOS features have not been tested.

## Usage Instructions 
- Download the plugin and enable it.
- If enabled correctly, there should be a new workspace option within your project.
- This dock has four parts: a directory selector (where you want to save your engine), a console (to show you what's happening), a panel showing version information (current, latest, and an option to enable .NET support), and a button to install the latest update.
- Press execute and your engine should download the latest update!
